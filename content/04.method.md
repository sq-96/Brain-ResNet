#### 1. Enrichment of ASoC Variants
All single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within functional regions (open chromatin or H3K27ac) in each cell type are retrieved from 1000 Genomes Project. SNVs are then ranked by MetaChrom score, Funsig score and CADD score in descending order and the top 10,000 variants are selected as potential functional variants. In each functional regions, we also randomly sampled 100,000 variants as control variants. Funsig score is from the DeepSEA Server and CADD score is from annovar.
