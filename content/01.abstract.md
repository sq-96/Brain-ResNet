## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Decoding the regulatory behavior of DNA sequences and the functional effects of noncoding variants is a preeminent challenge in understanding the mechanisms of gene regulation. This is also important for the genetics of common diseases, as most disease-associated variants are located in noncoding regions of the genome. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based methods have been developed to predict genome-wide chromatin profiles in various cellular contexts. However, these tools and resources were often trained in cell lines or bulk tissues that are not necessarily disease-related. This is particularly an issue for neuropsychiatric disorders, where the most relevant cell and tissue types are missing in the training data used by current tools.
